  ## Description

  The Colony is a PC and mobile app designed to function as a NASA and space inspired social platform. Here a user can view current Mars Rover info, develop their own profile (planet/zodiac selection, city's weather, and their Mars age/weight), and post to the Colony's feed. The app's main intent is to enable users to experience their city's activity (people, places, and events) via the Feed page.
